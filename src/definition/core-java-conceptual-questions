Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A.programming language is a set of commands, instructions, and other syntax use to create a software program.
What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?

A.JDK contain JRE, compiler and debugger.
          --->JRE - java RunTime Environment
          --->Compiler - convert source code to intermediate code which is known as java bytecode.
          --->Debugger - provide inspection and debugging.

What is IDE?
A.Integrated Development Environment.It is a software application which enables users to more easily write and debug Java programs.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A. Eclipse, Intellij, NetBeans.
Explain the entire java life cycle.
A.Java's life cycle starts with writing source code in a note pad or sublime or eclipse.
Then we call the compiler java to produce byte codes. Java compiler creates class file.
Once the source code goes through compiler it produces bytecodes.
Then the java loader JVM interprets that in machine language and sends it to the operation system and it gives output.

what is class?
A. class is a blue print of an object.

What is object?
A.Object is an instance of a class.

What is the entry point of an application?
A. main method.

Why main is static?
A. Main is static to ensures that it can be called from outside(system) without needing to create an object of
the parent class. The main method is static because they can be invoked by the runtime engine without having
to instantiate an instance of the parent class.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A. java.lang.Object

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A.Classpath-- Classpath is system environment variable used by the Java compiler and JVM.
  Path-- Path is an environment variable which is used by the operating system to find the executables.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A.Interface -- In interface we cannot declare a body. All methods in Interface are abstract. We can have multiple
      methods in abstract.
  Abstract class -- In abstract class we have to implement the body. Abstract class can have non abstract methods.
      It can also have abstract method which is not implemented.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A. No,we can not. Instead we can instantiate one of their subclasses.

what is Access Specifier?
A. The access to classes, constructors, methods and fields using access modifiers. (public, private, protected,default)

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A. Object Oriented Programming
--->Inheritance -When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance
--->Encapsulation- It is data hiding
--->Abstraction - It is implementation hiding
--->Polymorphism - is basically an ability to take on many forms. Two types of Polymorphism (Overloading and Overriding)

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A. A Package can be defined as a grouping of related types classes, interfaces, enumerations and annotations providing
access protection and namespace management.
java.lang package is imported package by default.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A. API is Application Program Interface.
We have used BufferedReader, FileReader, Scanner, String.

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A. Java doesnâ€™t allow multiple inheritance to avoid the ambiguity caused by it.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A.In overloading we can have the same method name but different parameters
  It happens in compile time
Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A.It is an event which occurs during the execution of a program which disrupts the program's instructions. It is
  handled by try and catch block.
What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A. The he static keyword denotes that a member variable, or method, can be accessed without requiring
   an instantiation of the class to which it belongs when static key word is used with a method that method can
   be called without creating a object.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A.Final is used to apply restrictions on class, method and variable.Final class can't be inherited,
final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed.
What is final, finally and finalize?
A.Final is used to apply restrictions on class, method and variable. Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed. it's a method
  -Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not. It's a block
  -Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected. Finalize is a method.

What is a constructor ?
A.Constructor is used to initialize an object.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A. Yes.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A. default constructor

What is "this" keyword in java ?
A. this key word represents instance of the class. this can be used to access class methods and variables.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A. super key word used for accessing the members of the super class by the extended class.

What is JVM stand for ?
A. Java Virtual Machine

Is JVM platform independent?
A. Yes
What version of java are you using?
A. 10.0.2

What is JAR stand for ?
A.Java Archive is a package file format typically used to aggregate many Java class files and associated metadata and
  resources (text, images, etc.) into one file for distribution.

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A.Java Development Kit (JDK) is Kit which provides the environment to develop and execute the Java program.
  Java Virtual machine(JVM) is a very important part of both JDK and JRE because it is contained or inbuilt in both.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
What is compile time and run time?
What is heap?

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
What is Singleton class?
What is Serialization and Deserialization?
