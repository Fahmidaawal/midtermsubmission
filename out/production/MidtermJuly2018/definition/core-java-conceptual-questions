Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A.programming language is a set of commands, instructions, and other syntax use to create a software program.
What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?

A.JDK contain JRE, compiler and debugger.
          --->JRE - java RunTime Environment
          --->Compiler - convert source code to intermediate code which is known as java bytecode.
          --->Debugger - provide inspection and debugging.

What is IDE?
A.Integrated Development Environment.It is a software application which enables users to more easily write and debug Java programs.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A. Eclipse, Intellij, NetBeans.
Explain the entire java life cycle.
A.Java's life cycle starts with writing source code in a note pad or sublime or eclipse.
Then we call the compiler java to produce byte codes. Java compiler creates class file.
Once the source code goes through compiler it produces bytecodes.
Then the java loader JVM interprets that in machine language and sends it to the operation system and it gives output.

what is class?
A. class is a blue print of an object.

What is object?
A.Object is an instance of a class.

What is the entry point of an application?
A. main method.

Why main is static?
A. Main is static to ensures that it can be called from outside(system) without needing to create an object of
the parent class. The main method is static because they can be invoked by the runtime engine without having
to instantiate an instance of the parent class.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A. java.lang.Object

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A.Classpath-- Classpath is system environment variable used by the Java compiler and JVM.
  Path-- Path is an environment variable which is used by the operating system to find the executables.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A.Interface -- In interface we cannot declare a body. All methods in Interface are abstract. We can have multiple
      methods in abstract.
  Abstract class -- In abstract class we have to implement the body. Abstract class can have non abstract methods.
      It can also have abstract method which is not implemented.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A. No,we can not. Instead we can instantiate one of their subclasses.

what is Access Specifier?
A. The access to classes, constructors, methods and fields using access modifiers. (public, private, protected,default)

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A. Object Oriented Programming
--->Inheritance -When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance
--->Encapsulation- It is data hiding
--->Abstraction - It is implementation hiding
--->Polymorphism - is basically an ability to take on many forms. Two types of Polymorphism (Overloading and Overriding)

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A. A Package can be defined as a grouping of related types classes, interfaces, enumerations and annotations providing
access protection and namespace management.
java.lang package is imported package by default.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A. API is Application Program Interface.
We have used BufferedReader, FileReader, Scanner, String.

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A. Java doesnâ€™t allow multiple inheritance to avoid the ambiguity caused by it.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A.In overloading we can have the same method name but different parameters
  It happens in compile time
Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A.It is an event which occurs during the execution of a program which disrupts the program's instructions. It is
  handled by try and catch block.
What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A. The he static keyword denotes that a member variable, or method, can be accessed without requiring
   an instantiation of the class to which it belongs when static key word is used with a method that method can
   be called without creating a object.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A.Final is used to apply restrictions on class, method and variable.Final class can't be inherited,
final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed.
What is final, finally and finalize?
A.Final is used to apply restrictions on class, method and variable. Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed. it's a method
  -Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not. It's a block
  -Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected. Finalize is a method.

What is a constructor ?
A.Constructor is used to initialize an object.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A. Yes.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A. default constructor

What is "this" keyword in java ?
A. this key word represents instance of the class. this can be used to access class methods and variables.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A. super key word used for accessing the members of the super class by the extended class.

What is JVM stand for ?
A. Java Virtual Machine

Is JVM platform independent?
A. Yes
What version of java are you using?
A. 10.0.2

What is JAR stand for ?
A.Java Archive is a package file format typically used to aggregate many Java class files and associated metadata and
  resources (text, images, etc.) into one file for distribution.

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A.Java Development Kit (JDK) is Kit which provides the environment to develop and execute the Java program.
  Java Virtual machine(JVM) is a very important part of both JDK and JRE because it is contained or inbuilt in both.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A. The Java Runtime Environment(JRE) provides the minimum requirements for executing a Java application.
    Java Virtual Machine (JVM)it is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed.
    It can also run those programs which are written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode.
What is compile time and run time?
A. Java compile the .java file to .class file, this stage is called compile time.
   java loader loads the .class file in JVM and JVM executes the application.
   This execution time of a application is called run time.
What is heap?
A. Runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays are located.

How java manage it's memory?
A.Java objects reside in an area called the heap. The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease
  in size while the application runs.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A.String is immutable, if you try to alter their values, another object getscreated, whereas
  StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable so they can change their values.StringBuffer methods are
  synchronized while StringBuilder methods are non-synchronized, it means that for thread-safe operations
  you must choose StringBuffer class instead of StringBuilder.

What is Singleton class?
A.Singleton class is to control object creation by keeping private constructor

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
A. Serialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or
   database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization

when to use transient variable in java?
A.the transient keyword to indicate to the Java virtual machine that the indicated variable is not part of the persistent state of the object.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
A. Contrast with the while loop, which tests the condition before the code within the block is executed,
   the do-while loop is an exit-condition loop. This means that the code must always be executed first and
   then the expression or test condition is evaluated. If it is true, the code executes the body of the loop again.

What is Enum?
A.Enum is a special Java type used to define collections of constants.
  More precisely, a Java enum type is a special kind of Java class. An enum can contain constants, methods etc.

What is Iterator?
A. An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
A.int and Integer both represents same number of values.

Why is String Immutable in Java?
A.string objects are immutable. Immutable simply means unmodifiable or unchangeable.
 Once string object is created its data or state can't be changed but a new string object is created.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
A.Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
A.Serial Collector is mostly designed for single-threaded environments.
  Parallel Garbege Collector is used for multi-threaded environments.

What is JIT stands for?
A. Just In Time Operator

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
A.Java objects reside in an area called the heap. The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease in size while the application runs.
  Garbage collection is the process of looking at heap memory, identifying which objects are in use and which are not, and deleting the unused objects.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A. NO
What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
A.When an object is created its stored in the heap
   -->Stack creates a memory to the created object
   -->Stack is used for static memory allocation and Heap for dynamic memory allocation.
   -->Both stored in the computer's RAM.
   -->Variables allocated on the stack are stored directly to the memory and access to this memory is very fast,
   -->The stack is always reserved in a Last In First Out (LIFO) order, the most recently reserved block is always the next block to be freed.
   -->This makes it really simple to keep track of the stack, freeing a block from the stack is nothing more than adjusting one pointer.
   -->Variables allocated on the heap have their memory allocated at run time and accessing this memory is a bit slower,
   -->The heap size is only limited by the size of virtual memory.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
A. Reflection is used to describe code which is able to ispect other code in the same system. it help the user gain
insight and see how to move foward.

what is multithreading in java?
A. It is the process that we use to execute multiple threads simultaneously.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
A. Is used to provide mutually exclusive acces to a shared resource with multiple java threads.

What is Framework?
A. A framework is nothing but large bodies of java codes where you can apply your own code to solve problems in the
specific domain.

What are the testing Framework available in java?
A. Selenium
   testNG
   JUnit
   Cucumber
   DB Unit.

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
A. The main difference is the scope and dependency.

What are the dependencies for this project?
A. The dependecies are:
   mongo-java-driver-3.4.0.jar
   mysql-connector-java-5.1.41-bin.jar

what is dependency injection in java?
A. This means that if I create an file or program with some dependencies I also include the dependencies on the project
so if another user try to acces to it, it has the dependencies already in it.

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
A.The binding which can be resolved at compile time by compiler is known as static or early binding. Binding of all
  the static, private and final methods is done at compile-time.
